> To start, it's important to note that the basic five-letter guessing game underlying **Wordle** is not itself a completely original idea. The same basic gameplay was popularized by *Lingo*, a game show that dates back to the '80s in the US and other countries. The two-player pen-and-paper game *Jotto*, which goes back to 1955, would also be very familiar to Wordle players.

## Introduction

In this *Wordle* game, instead of daily word challenge, here you can play this game with your friends by setting the word by yourself. The game play is very simple. 

This *Wordle* gives players six chances to guess the word selected by your friend. If you have the right letter in the right spot, it shows up green. A correct letter in the wrong spot shows up yellow. A letter that isn't in the word in any spot shows up gray. 

You can enter a total of six words, meaning you can enter five burner words from which you can learn hints about the letters and their placements. Then you get one chance to put those hints to use [[2]](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/wordle-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-viral-word-game/).
